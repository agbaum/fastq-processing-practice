# A project for practicing OOP in python.

The general idea of the project is that reads through paired fastq files, compiles various statistics on them, and then outputs those statstics in various ways (plots, tables, etc.).

# TODOs
* Write plotting output
* Figure out how/if to do test for outputs
* Figure out integration/application level testing
